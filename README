Locale::Maketext::Gettext - Joins the gettext and Maketext frameworks

Locale::Maketext::Gettext joins the GNU gettext and Maketext
frameworks.  It is a subclass of Locale::Maketext that follows the
way GNU gettext works.  It works seamlessly, both in the sense of
GNU gettext and Maketext.  As a result, you enjoy both their
advantages, and get rid of both their problems, too.

You start as an usual GNU gettext localization project:  Work on
PO files with the help of translators, reviewers and Emacs.  Turn
them into MO files with msgfmt.  Copy them into the appropriate
locale directory, such as
/usr/share/locale/de/LC_MESSAGES/myapp.mo.

Then, build your Maketext localization class, with your base class
changed from Locale::Maketext to Locale::Maketext::Gettext.  That's
all. ^_*'


* Locale::Maketext::Gettext::Functions

Locale::Maketext::Gettext::Functions is a functional
interface to Locale::Maketext::Gettext (and Locale::Maketext).
It works completely the GNU gettext way.  It plays magic to
Locale::Maketext.  No more localization class/subclasses and language
handles are required.


* The maketext script

The maketext script is a command-line interface to
Locale::Maketext::Gettext (and Locale::Maketext).  It can be used in
shell scripts, etc, to translate, maketext and return the
result.  It enables Maketext to be integrated into other programming
languages/systems, like bash/csh, python, PHP, C, etc.  It works
like the command-line program gettext.
