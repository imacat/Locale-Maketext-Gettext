Thanks to Sean M. Burke, for writing such a great localization framework as
Locale::Maketext, especially for his ideas about the plural forms.

Thanks to the GNU group, for writing such a great localization framework as
GNU gettext, especially for the completeness and simplicity of its design.

Thanks for Autrijus Tang <autrijus@autrijus.org> for writing
Locale::Maketext::Lexicon.  It inspires me to import %Lexicon from other
sources.  Also thanks for approving such a project that is a competition to
his own Locale::Maketext::Lexicon. :p

Thanks to Max Maischein <corion@corion.net> for reporting CPAN tester failures
200029, 200332 and 200331, that helps me finding the shell character escaping
problem on my test suite.

Thanks to Andreas Koenig <andk@cpan.org> for reporting CPAN tester failures
387357 and submitting rt bug 23956, informing me the base class
Locale::Maketext has updated its error handling behavior in the Perl 5.9.

Thanks to Chris Travers <chris.travers@gmail.com> for suggestion on
implementing pgettext() in GNU gettext as pmaketext().

Finally, well, :p thanks to Larry Wall, for writing such a
great programming language, as Perl.
